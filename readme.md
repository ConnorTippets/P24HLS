# P24HLS

Currently only converts to HL2 instead of HLS. It might work for HLS, idk \
\
If you want textures (which i imagine you do), VTF.py and MDL.py are your friends. \
Give them the path to the directory you extracted from the .vpk's and they will patch the textures. \
\
If you want COMPLETE texture and cubemap parity, you need to know how to extract and recompress pakfiles. \
Do your own research for this. \
\
Do "main.py -h" for information on the main program.
